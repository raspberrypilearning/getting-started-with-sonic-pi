## Use samples

Not only can you create music in Sonic Pi using single notes, you can also create music with samples. Samples are pre-recorded sounds or tunes that you can bring into your music. This is a really simple way to make your music sound amazing!

To use a sample, you need to add the code `sample :name of sample` in the sequence of your music program where you want it to play.

In this example, `loop_amen` is the name of the sample:

```ruby
2.times do
  sample :loop_amen
  sleep 1.753
end
```
